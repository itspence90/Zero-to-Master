# Zero-to-Master
projects from zero to master course on udemy
This folder is specifically a project-hosting folder from my time during the course of The Complete Web Developer of 2018: Zero to Mastery

Please make pulls and suggested commits to anything you find would be beneficial as this will probably be used for my portfolio.

I will continue to make commits and new changes to this as I progress.
